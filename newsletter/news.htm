<h1>Apple of Our Ear: Google's Voice Search App Finally Live</h1>
<span class="date2">November 19th, 2008</span>

<p>After much speculation about why Apple did not post the new version of the Google Mobile App for iPhone that lets users search via voice and location on its Web site, the app has finally passed muster late Monday.</p>

<p>Google said you may now download it for free here from the Google Mobile site, or you can download the app from the iPhone App Store by searching for "Google Mobile App." </p>

<h1>First Looks Special: Kensington SX2000 Speakers </h1>
<span class="date2">November 19th, 2007</span>

<p>Fresh at the iLounge iLounge.com labs: Kensingtons SX2000 Speakers ($160), the second iPod speaker system we’ve received that claims support for Apple’s “Universal Dock” standard. Here are a few pictures and details to bring you up to speed before our review.</p>

<p>SX2000 is a flat-panel speaker system based on NXT technology - which we’ve heard in the past, and not been especially impressed by. This particular implementation appears to be better than the last NXT we tested (Monster’s iSpeaker Portable) on audio quality, but still not mind-blowing. In a list of features, Kensington notes that the speaker features “bi-directional” technology (the ability to play audio from its back or front) - put it in the middle of a room and you’ll hear audio from both sides. The rear of the unit also includes a port for auxiliary audio input - devices other than docking iPods can connect through this if you have your own cable.</p>

<h1>Analyst says Apple could ship over 37 million <span class="lowercase">I</span>Pods in 2005</h1>
<span class="date2">November 17th, 2007</span>

<p>Piper Jaffray senior analyst Gene Munster expects Apple to ship approximately 37 million iPods in 2005. “We expect the iPod to continue to be a foundation for growth in other parts of Apple’s business, and we expect that by the end of CY05 more than 37 million iPods will have shipped, providing Apple with a greater scope of awareness for various products (halo effect),” Munster said in a research note obtained by iLounge. “It appears that this phenomenon has begun to take effect, with a record 1.23 million Macs shipped in the September quarter.”</p>

<p>Munster also notes that iPod models are still dominating Amazon Top Seller Lists. “We believe that the iPod is continuing to gain traction in the December quarter as evidenced by the number of iPods included on the Amazon Top Seller List for portable MP3 players and All Electronics,” he said. “The number of iPods in the Top 10 increased by one, from 7 to 8 since our last update on October 21. Apple has 2 products in the Top 10 Sellers List of All Electronics and 4 in the Top 20.”</p>

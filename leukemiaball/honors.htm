<p>In its seventh year, the Congressional Honors Award recognizes two Members of Congress who have been instrumental in forwarding and advancing support for blood cancer research as well as being champions of other matters that would be of concern to patients and their families fighting cancer.</p>

<p>The awards are presented in fond memory of Congressman Joe Moakley, who succumbed to leukemia in 2001 and who was honored posthumously with the 2002 Congressional Honors Award. Each year, the recipients are recognized at Society's Leukemia Ball and at an exclusive reception on Capitol Hill with members of Congress and staffers from both sides of the aisle. Sponsors are invited to attend this private reception.</p>

<p>The principal sponsors of the Congressional Honors Program are The Virginia Sheldon Jerome Foundation and The Laborer’s Charitable Foundation. Funding for the program supports the Society's translational research program, which strives to accelerate laboratory findings into clinical application, giving hope to patients desperately in need of new treatment methods when traditional therapy options fail.</p>

<p><span class="bold">2007 Recipients:</span></p>

<p>Congressman Mike Ferguson (R-NJ) represents New Jersey’s 7th Congressional District 7th in the U.S. House of Representatives. First elected in 2000, Congressman Ferguson is serving in his fourth term in the 110th Congress (2007-2008). On Capitol Hill, Congressman Ferguson serves on the House Energy and Commerce Committee as the Vice Chairman of the Health Subcommittee, which has wide jurisdiction over health care and the welfare of millions of Americans. Congressman Ferguson has been a strong advocate for patients with chronic and life-threatening diseases. He has supported federally funded research at the National Institutes of Health and research in umbilical cord blood for the treatment of blood cancers.</p>

<p>Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) first won election to the U.S. Congress from Iowa's Fifth Congressional District in 1974 and served in the House of Representatives for ten years. In 1984, he won election to the U.S. Senate. Iowans returned him to the U.S. Senate in 1990, 1996 and again in 2002, making him the first Iowa Democrat ever to earn a fourth Senate term. In Congress, Senator Harkin is a recognized leader in areas including education, health care and agriculture. Along with Republican Senator Arlen Specter, Senator Harkin has led the effort to double medical research funding to speed up cures for killers like leukemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma.</p>

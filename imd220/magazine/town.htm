<span class="heading">Location</span>
<br/><br/>
Ashburn, Virginia is an unincorporated area located in Loudoun County, Virginia, 30 miles west of Washington, D.C., and is part of the Washington Metropolitan Area. The area serves as headquarters for the internet service provider Verizon Business, Old Dominion Brewing Company, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) at Janelia Farm. Redskins Park, the headquarters for the Washington Redskins of the National Football League, is also located in Ashburn.
</p>

<p><span class="heading">History</span></p>

<p>
Ashburn was originally called Farmwell (variant names include Old Farmwell and Farmwell Station) after a nearby mansion of that name owned by George Lee III. The name Farmwell first appeared in George Lee's October 1802 will and was used to describe the 1,236 acre plantation he inherited from his father, Thomas Ludwell Lee II. A section of Farmwell plantation west of Ashburn Road, a 580 acre tract, was purchased in 1841 by lawyer and almost vice-president John Janney, a Quaker, as a summer home. John Janney called the property Ashburn Farm (first known written use is 1870 when he sold the property). It is likely he named the farm after family friends named Ashburn.[1]
</p>
<p>
In 1895, Ashburn Farm was purchased by Senator William Morris Stewart. Local legend has it that the village, known until then as Farmwell or Farmwell Station, got its new name after lightning struck an ash tree on Senator Stewart's farm in 1896. The ash tree is rumored to have burned and smoldered for a week and attracted spectators from miles around. Since the Post Office had been pressing for a new name for the village (to avoid confusion with Farmville in Prince Edward County, Virginia), and the Senator was the area's leading citizen, the villagers renamed the village after the ash burn.[2]
</p>
<p>
Today, Ashburn's population is slightly over 73,000 as of 2006 and is one of the largest unincorporated areas of Loudoun County. Many of its citizens commute into Washington, D.C. and the surrounding suburbs such as Tysons Corner and Reston to their places of employment.
</p>
<p>
Ashburn is served by Briar Woods High School, Broad Run High School, Stone Bridge High School. It also has 3 middle schools and several elementary schools that serve the fast growing population.
</p>
<p>
Ashburn has multiple golf courses and two universities, and it is located between Washington Dulles International Airport and Leesburg, the county seat of Loudoun County. Located within the Dulles Technology Corridor, Ashburn is home to many high-tech businesses . Additionally, construction of the World Trade Center Dulles Airport at One Loudoun is set to begin in the fall of 2007.
</p>
<p>
Ashburn is also the home to four landmarks on the National Register of Historic Places: Belmont Plantation (1799), the Broad Run Bridge and Toll House (1820), the sanctuary of Ashburn Presbyterian Church (1878), and Janelia Farm (1936).[3]
</p>
<p>
Ashburn's Fire and EMS services are provided by a combination of the volunteers of Ashburn Volunteer Fire-Rescue Department and The Loudoun County Department of Fire, Rescue &amp; Emergency Management.

<p>
Is the inventory being down and buyer activity holding steady even during the holiday season, a sign of the “bottom” in Ashburn?
</p>
<p>
A buyer’s market is still very much the case in Leesburg with Sterling showing some signs of future stability, but we’re not quite there yet. Ashburn on the other hand is showing signs of a more balance market with inventory being below the 450 mark.
</p>
<p>
With the spring approaching and the possibilty of increased inventory coming on the market, now may be the best time for owners to sell their properties. With less competition on the market now, buyers have less to choose from.
</p>
<p>
For buyers, waiting for the approaching “spring market” (beginning in February) may be the best course of action. With increased inventory and rates hopefully holding steady, you may be in a better position as a buyer than this month or January.
</p>
<p>
Though there are signs of a bottom in the near future, how much inventory floods the market will dictate which way the market goes. If we see inventory spike up, we may have a ways to go.

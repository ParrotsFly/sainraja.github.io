 <p>Loudoun County might be seeing yet another town center developed in Ashburn in the coming years.
In February, Norton Scott LLC, announced it was applying to rezone 424 acres at the intersection of Route 28 and Route 7 in order to develop a mixed-use business community. The proposed development would include residential, retail, civic and office development on 239 usable acres, leaving 185 acres for a natural park within the Broad Run watershed. If approved, Kincora would develop approximately 4.2 million square feet of office space, 291,000 square feet of retail and 1,400 residential homes.
“Kincora will be a Class A employment center located at the crossroads of the county’s education, Route 7, and its commercial corridors,” a presentation on Norton Scott’s Web site said.
</p>
<p>Kincora would be larger than the mixed-use development One Loudoun, which the board approved in January. The 358-acre One Loudoun development was approved only after major amendments to the proposal, including the requirement for building nonresidential and residential development concurrently and a drop in the number of allowed residential units from more than 2,000 to 1,040 units. Kincora’s developers also submitted one of 13 proposals for the new county government center.</p>

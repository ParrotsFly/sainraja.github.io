<h1>A Balanced Market Continues</h1>

<p>Real Estate activity continues to remain balanced between buyers and sellers in most parts of Loudoun County.  Despite some inclement weather, sales remained steady and listings were tame.  This led to inventory levels staying at around 2050 for the entire county.  Active listings have been hovering at this level for the past 9 weeks.   Look for these levels to start to increase as the spring market for sellers kicks into high gear in the next 8 weeks.  Hopefully interest rates will remain low and buyer activity will keep pace.</p>

<h1>20164 Section of Sterling is Lagging the rest of County</h1>

<p>While most zip codes of Loudoun County saw little if any build up of inventory, the 20164 section of Sterling saw listings outpace sales by 52%.  This was by far the worst performing area of Loudoun County in the month of February.  A closer looked showed that the median list price for homes that have gone under contract this year in 20164 has been $369,900 while the median list price for the 305 actives is $399,900 as of March 1.  This means that the average home is currently overprice by $30,000. </p>

<h1>Resale Activity near 2002 Levels</h1>

<p>Through the first two months of 2007, the sales activity has been the same as the first two months of 2002 when looking at units sold.  In January and February of 2002 sales were 434 and 397 respectively.  This year the numbers are 462 and 399.  In March of 2002 we had sales of 529 and we should expect to see numbers at these levels this year given the current trends and seasonality.</p>

<h1>Prices Remain Firm</h1>

<p>
Median list prices for Loudoun County have been at or near the $425,000 level since September of last year and this month was no exception.  As of today the median list price for homes that went under contract was $429,900.  Although the final sales price is going to be lower than the list price in almost every case, the list prices give you an indication of what level you need to be at to get a buyer to write a contract.

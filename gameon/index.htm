<h2>Prince of Persia</h2>
<h1>October 16th, 2008</h1>

<p>
Prince of Persia is getting a complete revamp with a new story. The game won't be continuing from where the Two Thrones left off. We have a new prince, new art style. Everything in the game has changed. You have to work with another AI character in the game, similar to how you had to work with Farah in the Sands of Time but your AI partner will help you more compared to before. She will help you with platforming, fighting etc.</p>
